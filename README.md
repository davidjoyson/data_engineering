# Academic Performance Prediction via Data Fusion

This project implements a machine learning pipeline that predicts student academic outcomes by fusing data from multiple distinct sources. Unlike traditional models that rely solely on past grades, this system integrates demographic data, behavioral logs (attendance, LMS activity), and historical performance metrics. By applying Ensemble Learning / Stacking / Feature Concatenation, the model achieves higher predictive accuracy, allowing educators to identify at-risk students earlier and provide targeted interventions.
